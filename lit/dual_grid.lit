@title gif to tile set

@s Using imagemagick and .ppm filetype

I want to convert the gif file from grafx2 to a c array.
The first step is to convert the binary gif format into a more human readable format, which is a version of ppm

- The use of `assets/tiled_world_layer_%02d.ppm`, specifically `%02d` means when we make multiple files, name them with a 2 digit number here.
- There is use of the `-coalesce` option here, as an ordinary gif file will not retain the orginal size of the layer, but instead try to shorten it down. This may be useful as it would also mean less checks for underlay fill tiles, but for sake of simplicity I won't do that.
--- gif_to_array.sh
#!/usr/bin/sh
# you have to set the world as non-transparent, i.e. by selecting an unused color as the transparent color.
convert assets/tiled_world_layers.gif -coalesce -compress none assets/tiled_world_layer_%02d.ppm # split gif to seperate frames
