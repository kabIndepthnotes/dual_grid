dual_grid is a simple tilemap editor that converts a tilemap (a glorified gif file) into a level and a set of raylib rectangles, ready for a game.

# Quick start
- edit the tilegrid assets/tiled_world_layers.gif, this is the grid that the player can move around in, such as a level. Use white for the tiles and black for the background.
- edit the tileset assets/dual_grid_tiles_production.gif, this is what dual_grid uses to draw the tilegrid. see assets/dual_grid_tiles_template.gif for a template.
- run `make linux` to generate the tilemap.c, the individual tiles.
- view the dual grid you made in with `./linux_build/main`
